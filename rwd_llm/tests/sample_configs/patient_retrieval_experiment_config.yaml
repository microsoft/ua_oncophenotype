defaults:
  # The 'defaults' section is a langchain construct that injects external configs.  Here
  # we inject specific 'chain' and 'dataset' components from config/experiment/chain and
  # config/experiment/dataset subdirectories.
  #
  # Select the dataset and add it as the 'dataset' key at the root level of the config.
  # This is added to config/resources via interpolation (${...} syntax) so it will be
  # instantiated once but can be referenced multiple locations in the config.  In this
  # case it's referenced by config/experiment/dataset and within the
  # patient_retrieval_chain
  - config/experiment/dataset@dataset: sample_patient_dataset
  - config/experiment/dataset@note_dataset: sample_note_dataset
  # Select the chain to run.  Without the '@' syntax used with dataset above, it is
  # injected at the location corresponding to the directory structure, here
  # config/experiment/chain.
